# LowCodeFusion
LowCodeFusion is a Pulumi‑style SDK generator that transforms Pliant’s automation‑library definitions into native modules for Python, Node.js, and beyond—providing a code‑first, imperative interface to automate infrastructure with full IDE autocomplete support. Requires a fully licensed Pliant instance to serve as the backend.
